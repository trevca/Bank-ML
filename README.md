# Bank Project
## Authors: Trevor Carpenter, Ryan Buchner, Bobby Chow

### Questions
1. How do the prediction variables interact to predict whether or not a client will sign on to a long-term deposit?
2. Is the updated data necessary to improve that predictor, meaning can we be just as accurate with the not-additional dataset?
3. Can we predict education level from the other predictors and does filling in (imputing) the “unknown” values with that prediction improve the model?
